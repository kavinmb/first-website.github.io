<h4>
At the age of eleven harry potter started getting letters while in his aunt's and uncle's house they were invites to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry
he met friends on the train to go there called Ron weasleay and Hermione granger who appeared too competetive initally but they became best friends .
 when he entered the school the sorting was first there were 4 houses gryfffindor for the brave and bold ,slytherin for the clever and quick,ravenclaw for intelligent and good hearted hufflepuff for loyal people harry and his two best friends got sorted to gryffindor while his arch enemy draco malfoy got sorted to slytherin
.
 In christmas he got a cloak which mad him invisible so he snukt up to the head masters office and saw a mirror in which he saw his mother and father,headmaster Dumledore saw him and told him never to dwell on what the mirror since it was the mirror of erisings shows hopes and dreams and drove some people mad .
few days later he became selected as the worlds youngest quiditch player in centuries quiditch was a game on flying brooms.
 .While having dinner proffesor quirinus quirell their defence against dark arts teacher came running into the great hall and said a troll was in the girls bathroom on the third floor and headmaster albus wulfric brian dumbledor told the students to go to their houses common rooms however harry and ron went to save hermione as she had gone to that very same bathroom and saved hermione from the  troll . 
When the teachers found out they sent the trio back to the common room but the trio lost their way and went into a room with a massive three headed dog they went away as fast as they could.
Later harry asked hagrid their school gamekeeper as to what the dog was hagrid let it slip that the dog was guarding a thing between Dumbledore and Nicolas flamel .
Hermione searched in the library and found he had made the sorcerers stone which made the elixir of life which made the drinker immortal
Harry thought Snape who was his potions teacher was trying to steal it since hagrid said someone gave him a dragon egg and asked how to get past the three headed dog  whom hagrid called fluffy hagrid said music the trio thought a teacher and went to the same place again to find a enchanted harp playing and fluffy asleep.
they saw a trapdoor and went down to find plants sinking them like quick sand hermion told harry and ron to relax and harry and hermione got out but ron was very scared hermione remembered to use sunlight and used lumos solem the sunlight spell and freed ron .
they found a rusted broom next and saw a key flying harry caught it with difficulty then they were able to open the door but only to find giant chess pieces they played the game and ron got almost fatally injured Hermione stayed behind and harry won.
next harry went to the place the stone was being kept and found it was professor Quirell, who voldermort had possesed .Voldermort was a very powerful dark wizard who killed harry's parents and was trying to kill him but had got his body destroyed in the process . Harry saw the mirror of erisings and saw the philosophers stone in his hands but lied that he was holding the house cup to not give the stone to voldermort
Quirell attacked at his masters orders but burned as he touched harry.
Dumbedore appeared and Voldermort fled killing Quirell in the process.
 Dumbledore destroyed the philosophers stone for good.
